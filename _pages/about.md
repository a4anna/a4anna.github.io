Hi! My name is Shilpa. I'm a third yr Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I'm advised by [Prof. Mahadev Satyanarayanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/). My research is mainly in edge computing, distributed systems, and computer vision. I am currently working on enabling interactive bandwidth-efficient visual search at the edge.

I received my B.Tech from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2014.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, painting, movies, reading, history, and politics.

One of my favourite paintings, [Landscape with the Fall of Icarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X75Roe_davA)
